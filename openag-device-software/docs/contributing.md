# Contributing

Welcome developers! We are a small team working on this code base and are excited to see
your interest with the OpenAg project. If you are interested in learning more about the
initiative check out the [Forum](https://forum.openag.media.mit.edu/) or 
[Wiki](https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/start).

Our latest hardware deployment is the 
[PFC 3.0](https://wiki.openag.media.mit.edu/pfc_edu_3.0) which we are working on 
making easier to purchase a dev kit for. In the mean time, if you want to get started 
now we recommend purchasing a beaglebone black or just running the code in 
`simulation mode` on a laptop with Ubuntu or OSX. The software is designed to easily
communicate with any I2C device. To see the currently supported sensors / actuators, 
check out the [peripheral modules](../device/peripherals/modules).

This code is written with `Python` where we try to follow standard best practices. For 
a short overview of these practices, check out: 
[Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), 
[Clean Code Summary](http://www.inf.fu-berlin.de/inst/ag-se/teaching/K-CCD-2014/Clean-Code-summary.pdf), 
[Code Style Guide (Black)](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style.html), 
and [Type Checking Intro](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/introduction.html).

To get up and running the fastest, watch all of the introductory videos to get familiar
with the code then install it and start the software in simulation mode with the 
`./simulate.sh` command. 

For all feature requests, bugs, or ideas for ways to contribute, check out this
