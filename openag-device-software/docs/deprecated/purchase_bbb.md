# Part 1: Purchase Beaglebone Black + SD Card

Back to [README](../README.md)...or...Forward to [Part 2: Prepare SD Card](prepare_sd.md)

## Steps
1. Purchase a Beaglebone Black Wireless [here](https://www.alliedelec.com/beagleboard-beaglebone-black-wireless/71064028/).
2. Purchase an 8G class 10 micro SD card [here](https://www.amazon.com/Sandisk-Extreme-SDHC-Class-SDSDRX3-8192-A21/dp/B003EGGTTS/ref=sr_1_3_sspa?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1537289436&sr=1-3-spons&keywords=8gb+class+10&refinements=p_n_feature_two_browse-bin%3A6518302011&psc=1).  
 - You can use a larger SD card if you like, but we use 8G cards because when we make a .iso file of the card to save to our google drive, the image will be smaller.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** You can also use a Beagle Bone Black *Ethernet* if you do not have access to reliable wifi or just prefer a wired connection. [Here](https://www.alliedelec.com/beagleboard-beaglebone-black/70338169/) is a purchase link.
